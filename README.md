**README.txt**

**Introduction**

This is a simple banking system written in Python. It uses a SQLite3 database to store account information. The system allows users to create accounts, log in to their accounts, check their balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and transfer money to other accounts.

**Usage**

To use the system, simply run the `main.py` file. The system will prompt you to choose one of the following options:

1. Create an account
2. Log into account
3. Exit

If you choose to create an account, the system will generate a random card number and PIN for you. You will need to provide these credentials to log in to your account.

If you choose to log in to your account, you will need to enter your card number and PIN. If the credentials are correct, you will be logged in to your account.

Once you are logged in to your account, you can choose from the following options:

1. Balance: Check your account balance.
2. Add income: Deposit money into your account.
3. Do transfer: Transfer money to another account.
4. Close account: Delete your account.
5. Log out: Log out of your account.
6. Exit: Exit the system.

**Requirements**

To run the system, you will need to have Python 3 and SQLite3 installed on your system.
